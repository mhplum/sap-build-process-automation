## Prerequisites 
  - Access to a [SAP BTP tenant with SAP Build Process Automation](spa-subscribe-booster)
  - [Configure SMTP Destination](https://help.sap.com/docs/build-process-automation/sap-build-process-automation/configuring-smtp-mail-destination) to send mail notifications.


## You will learn
  - How to create a SAP Build Process Automation project.
  - How to create a process that automates sales order creation and approval.
  - How to create an API trigger to integrate with any applications like SAP Build Apps, CAP etc.
  - How to send an Email notification.

---

## Intro
> **IMPORTANT:** Please refer to sample **Sales Order Management (MI04)** in the SAP Build Store if you face any issues while following the tutorials. To retrieve the sample refer to **step 6** of [Run the Sales Order Business Process](spa-academy-run-salesorderprocess).

With the new citizen automation user experience, you will get access to a new scope of opportunities for running your day-to-day workflows. In this tutorial, you will learn how a low-code and no-code tool can help you build the business process you need at the speed your business demands, using visual drag-and-drop tools for application development.

There are many use cases where you can make a difference using SAP Build Process Automation. During this tutorial, you will see how the Sales Order Approval process can be built using forms where a sales order is a document which confirms a sale that is generated by the seller after receiving a purchase order from the buyer. These sale order requests have to be reviewed and approved by the supplier to ensure that the sales orders are delivered on time. Once approved or rejected, the requester will be notified.

### Create a business process project


1. In the **Lobby**, choose **Create**.

    > The lobby is a central page for creating, accessing, and managing your projects in SAP Build. You can access business application processes, company configured templates, and other resources for your end-to-end business process.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Lobby](001.png)

2. Select **Automated Process** and choose **Next**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Create a Project](002.png)

3. Select **Process** and choose **Next**.

    > Business Process Projects are a collection of skills in SAP Build Process Automation. Projects are part of the internal business processes of a company and are defined based on business scenarios. A project can contain a set of processes, forms, automations and decisions, which are reusable artifacts.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Create a Project](003.png)


4. In the **Create a Business Process project** dialog box, do the following:

    - Enter a **Project Name** that starts with `Sales Orders Management`. In workshops, we recommend using the user identifier and then your initials, something like this: `Sales Orders Management_001_JFK`.

        >Tip: Always use a name that would help users distinguish your workspace from others.

    - Enter a **Description**: Sales Orders Management Project.
  
    - Choose **Review**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Project information](004.png)

5. In the **Create Project** dialog box, choose **Create**.

### Create a business process

    Once you have successfully created a Business Process Project, you will create a Business Process to automate the Sales Order Approval Process.


1. A new tabs opens with the newly created project.

2. In the **Create Process** dialog box, provide the following:

    - Enter a **Name**: Order Processing
    - Enter a **Description** for your process: A process to handle sales orders
    - Choose **Create**


    > Inside a project, you can create a process. This process is equivalent to a workflow in any business scenario. You can create this process from different skills such as forms, decisions, automations.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Create Process](005.png)

    > The form **Identifier** field is auto-filled.

  3. You are navigated to the Process Builder canvas.

     This is a visual canvas on which you map out your business process from start to finish. Other process artifacts are then added to this canvas, with process controls and connectors used to decide how information flows when the process is running.

     <!-- border -->
     ![Canvas](6.11.png)

    In the next step, you will create a data type  which would be used to integrate with SAP Build Apps and SAP Build Process Automation.   

### Create a data type

A data type is an artifact describing a data structure that can be used as an input and/or an output parameter in automations or processes.

[OPTION BEGIN [Import Excel File]]

You have two options to create the fields in data type. You can either import an excel file or define the fields manually.

In this option, you will be importing an excel file to create the data type. Based on the values present in the excel, the type of field is determined automatically and the fields are created accordingly. For example `orderAmount` is maintained as 19000, hence the type of the field `orderAmount` is determined as Number.


1.  Download [this](https://github.com/sap-tutorials/sap-build-process-automation/blob/main/tutorials/spa-academy-salesorder/SalesorderDatatype.xlsx) excel file for Sales Order datatype.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Create data type](6.6.png)

2.  Navigate to your project. Click on the **Project Content** icon on the top left corner > **+** > **Create** > **Data Type** .

    <!-- border -->
    ![Create data type](6.png)

3.  Name the data type **Sales Order**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![6.1](6.1.png)

4. Click on **Import Excel File**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![6.2](6.2.png)

5. Click on **Browse** to select the excel file.

6. Select **Import an Excel File**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![6.5](6.5.png)


    Your final data type looks as below.

    <!-- border -->
    ![DataType](6.3.png)



[OPTION END]

[OPTION BEGIN [Define Fields Manually]]

You have two options to create the fields in data type. You can either import an excel or define the fields manually.

In this option you will be defining each field with field name and type of field manually.

1.  Click on the **Project Content** icon on the top left corner > **+** > **Create** > **Data Type**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Create data type](6.png)

2.  Name the data type **Sales Order**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![6.1](6.1.png)

3. Click on **New Field** to add new fields to the data type **Sales Order**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![6.7](6.7.png)


4.  Repeat the process to add all the fields of the type as shown below.

    |  Field Name   | Type
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  `material`   | String  |
    |  `orderAmount`     | Number |
    |  `shipToParty`    | String|
    |  `salesOrderType`    | String|
    |  `salesOrganisation`    | String|
    |  `distributionChannel`  | String|
    |  `shippingCountry`    | String|
    |  `expectedDeliveryDate`  | Date|
    |  `division`  | String |

    >**IMPORTANT:** The spelling and casing of the fields, as well as any extra spaces, is crucial because the API to trigger the process will require the fields exactly as written.

    Your final data type looks as below.

    <!-- border -->
    ![DataType](6.3.png)

5. Click **Save** to save the data type.

[OPTION END]


### Create and configure API trigger

>You will build the initial screen of Sales Order Approval process using SAP Build Apps in the next tutorial. This API trigger will be invoked on a click of **Get Approval** button in SAP Build Apps.

The process can be triggered with a Form or using an API trigger. Since you are integrating a Sales Order Approval Process with SAP Build Apps, you will create an API trigger for the process. The inputs and outputs are configured for the API trigger and these inputs can then be used as input fields in your process, for example, in a form or approval form.

1.  Back on your Order Processing process page, in the process builder canvas, click on **Add a Trigger**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![New API Trigger](7.png)

2.  Choose **API Trigger**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![New API Trigger](7a.png)

3.  Enter the name as **Sales Order Trigger** and choose **Create**. The identifier is generated based on the name.

    <!-- border -->
    ![7.1](7.1.png)

4.  Open the **Process Details** side panel.
    
    <!-- border -->
    ![7.1](7.1a.png)
 
5.  Choose **Variables**. Then choose **Configure** to configure inputs.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Inputs](7.2.png)

6.  In the **Configure Process Inputs** window, choose **Add Input** to add parameters.

    Add the following parameter:

    |  **Name**    | **Type**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  `Sales Order Details`       | `Sales Order`

    Note: Type is a dropdown field which contains "Sales Order" as datatype.

7. Check the **Required** box.

8. **Apply** changes.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Add Inputs](7.3.png)

9.  **Save**  the project.

    The inputs are now displayed in the process details side panel.

    >These input fields will be mapped to fields in SAP Build Apps.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Add Inputs](7.3a.png)
  
10. Select the **Sales Order Trigger** to view the outputs.

    The API trigger outputs are synchronized from the process inputs.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Add Inputs](7.31.png)

### Create and configure approval form

Approvals are an important part of business processes, whether performed manually or automatically approved based on process conditions. In the Sales Order Approval Process, Supplier needs to review and approve the Sales Order requests.

With SAP Build Process Automation, you can manage approvals by creating and adding an approval form to a business process. Hence, you would create an Approval form for the Supplier where he/she can Accept/Reject the Sales Order request.

You can create interactive forms in SAP Build Process Automation. Forms can be used:

- as a start trigger for a process.
- as Approval Forms.
- as additional steps added in the same process.


Navigate back to the Process Builder canvas to create an Approval Form.

1. Go to the **Order Processing** process and choose **+** below the Trigger.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](8a.png)

2. Choose **Approval**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](8b.png)

3. Choose **Blank Approval**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](8c.png)

4. In the **Create Approval** dialog box, do the following:
    - In the Name field enter: **Approval Form**
    - In the Description field enter: **Form to approve or reject the sales order**
    - Choose **Create**

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval Form](8.1.png)

    <!-- border -->
    ![9.3](9.3.png)

6. **Save** the form.

7. Back in the process, click on the **Order Confirmation Form**  and configure the **Subject** and **Recipients**.

    In the **Subject** section:

    - Enter **Your order**
    - Select **Material** from the sales order details
    - Enter **has been approved**

    In the **Recipients** section, enter your login ID (email).

    In this tutorial, to complete the process, you will play the dual role of Supplier and Seller. Hence, you would map your email ID in the Notification Form as well.

    ![9.4](9.4.png)

8. Configure the inputs of **Order Confirmation Form**. Navigate to Inputs and map the fields accordingly.
   
9. Choose **Save**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![9.5](9.5.png)


### Create and configure order rejection notification through an email

Notifications can be sent via an Email or to the SAP Build Inbox of the Seller. Before adding mail notifications to a process, you must first configure your SMTP mail destinations for SAP Build Process Automation. Please refer to the pre-requisites to learn how to configure SMTP destination to send mail notifications. 

In this step, you will send out an email notification to the Seller if the Sales order is rejected. You need to configure the mail server to use the Mail Artifact.

1. To add an email notification to the process, select **+** below the **Reject** option.
   
    <!-- border -->
    ![Notifications](Mail_1a.png)

2. Choose **Email**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Notifications](Mail_1b.png)

3.  Once you have successfully added Email, you will configure **Mail Header** and **Mail Body**.
    
    In the **To** section, enter your personal or work email address.

    >Our SAP Build Process Automation is connected to a SMTP (i.e., mail) server and this process will send out a real email, so you want to enter an email address that you can check.

    In the **Subject** section, enter **Order Rejection Notification**.
    
    <!-- border -->
    ![Mail_2](mail_2.png)   

4. Click on **Open Mail Body Editor**.

    - Enter **Your order**
    - Select **material** from the `Sales Order Details`
    - Enter **has been rejected.**
    - Click on **Apply**

    <!-- border -->
    ![Mail_3](mail_3.png)  

5. Click on **Save**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Mail_4](mail_4.png)  

### Create and configure process condition

Once the process with forms is designed, define which process flow should run based on if/else condition criteria. During the Sales Order Approval process, the Sales order can be approved automatically based on certain condition. In this step, you will add a condition where the Sales order goes for Supplier approval if the Order amount is greater than 100000 else the Sales order is approved automatically.

1. To add a condition to a process open the **Process Builder**. Choose **+** below the Trigger. 

    <!-- border -->
    ![Process Condition](11a.png)

2. Choose **Controls and Events**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Process Condition](11b.png)
   
3. Choose **Condition**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Process Condition](11c.png)

4. To configure the condition, choose **Open Condition Editor**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Process Condition](11.1.png)

    > Process content will contain a list of attributes that have been defined in previous skills. For example: in the screenshot, you can see attributes from the API trigger. You will use this process content to configure different skills during business process modelling.

3. Edit your branch condition:

    - Set `orderAmount` from the process content
    - Select **is greater than**
    - Enter **100000** as the value
    - Choose **Apply**

    You have configured your **if** branch to: **if Order Amount is greater than 100000**. Both **If** and **Default** link branches are connected to the **Approval Form**.
   
4. Choose **Save**.

    With this process condition, only the sales order above a specific amount will be sent for approval and the rest will be auto-approved. You have to add a notification form in the **If** connection to notify the requester of the auto-approval and terminate the process.

### Create and configure auto approval notification form

In this step, you will create a notification form which would be received by supplier if the order is approved automatically without any approvals. With the Low-code capabilities, you need not to re-design the Form. Let's explore the **Duplicate** feature in SAP Build Process Automation.

1. To add the new form, you will use the **Duplicate** feature. 
    - Select the **Overview**.
    - Find **Order Confirmation Form** under the Artifacts section and choose **Duplicate**.

    > Copy functionality is used to copy the artifacts between two different projects.

2. In the **Duplicate Artifact** pop-up window, change the name to **Auto Approval Notification** and select **Duplicate**.

3. The form is automatically opened in the form builder. Change the Auto approval form in the form builder to reflect the data for auto approval use case.
   
    Design the notification form, the same way as in the previous steps, to send another notification to the  requester about auto-approval.

    Modify the  **Layout fields**:

    | **Form Fields** | **Field Settings with Label** | **Configuration(Read Only)**
    |  :------------- | :------------- | :-------------
    | Headline 1 | Automatic Order Confirmation | |
    | Paragraph  | Your order has been received and we will send you the details as soon as the order is shipped. You can find the details of your order below, please review and verify your request:| |
    | Paragraph  | Your Sales Order Details: | |
    | Text |  Material   | X
    | Text |  Customer Name | X
    | Number | Order Amount | X
    | Date | Expected Delivery Date | X
    | Paragraph | Please press the SUBMIT button to acknowledge the order status| |

    - Enter: **has been approved automatically**

    Under **Recipients**, enter your login ID (email).

### Save the project    

1. Click on **Save** to save your work.

    This completes the process design with condition criteria that will decide what process flow is executed and whether there will be an auto-approval or a one-step approval route. Now the business process is ready to integrate with SAP Build Apps.
