### Explore the store


The Store offers predefined content for your automation. Packages are categorized by catalog which let you choose between Automation SDK, Business Content and Learning Content.

1. Navigate to the store in your SAP Build Process Automation Tenant.

    <!-- border -->![Navigate Store](01.png)

    > **Learning Content** offers learning packages to get started with the Application Development tool. These packages allow you to learn best practices by reusing the most common flows to design your first projects.

    > **Business Content** provides pre-built automations for concrete business problems.

    > **Automation SDK** provides all the Software Developments Kits that can be acquired from the store.

2. Select one or more filters on the left to filter the available Store projects by Project Type (for example Process and Actions), Format Type (for example, Ready to use and Template), Catalog (for example, Business Content), Product (for example, SAP S/4HANA Cloud), Publisher, Line of Business, and Industry.

    <!-- border -->![Deployed Project](17-deployed-project.png)

    > You cannot edit released or deployed projects. To continue working on your project, you need to select the Editable option from the list of released versions.


### Set the agent in unattended mode


You need to create a matching agent attribute at this step. Please follow these steps to create an agent attribute in the tenant to add it to your agent and project: [Agent Management Settings to Execute the Process with an Automation](spa-run-agent-settings)
