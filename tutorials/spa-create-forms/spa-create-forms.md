# Create and Configure Forms
<!-- description --> Add forms to start the business process, send tasks for approvals and notify business users


## Prerequisites
  - Complete [Create a Business Process](spa-create-process) tutorial

## You will learn
  - How to add interactive forms to the process
  - How to design the form with layout and input fields using drag-and-drop approach
  - How to configure the forms as the process steps

---

## Intro
Tasks are a part of any business process. **SAP Build Process Automation** helps you to create forms that are made available to the business users in their inboxes to take relevant action.

These interactive forms can be created by dragging and dropping the text elements and input fields into the canvas. Once a form has been created, it can then be used as a process trigger to start the process or added as an approval step in the business process.

Let us now explore how these different forms are created. In the steps below, you will create three forms that will be used to:

- Start the approval process.
- Send a task to the inbox of the business user for approval.
- Notify the requester for approval or rejection.

---

### Create a form to trigger a business process


First, you will create a trigger form that will start the business process. For that, you have to open your process in the process builder and add a new form.

1. Choose **Add a Trigger** in the Trigger settings.
   
    <!-- border -->
    ![Form](001a.png)

2. Choose **Submit a Form**.
   
    <!-- border -->
    ![Form](001b.png)

3. Choose **Blank form**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Form](001c.png)

4. In the pop-up window for new form:

    - Enter the Name: **Order Processing Form**
    - Enter a Description: **Form to collect order details**
    - Choose **Create**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Form](002.png)

    The form will be added as the **Start Trigger**.

5. To design the form, choose the three dots and select **Open Editor**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Form](003.png)

6. You will now design the **Form** with available layout and input fields options. First, drag-and-drop the form layout fields and enter the given names and field settings as below:

    |  **Form Fields**    | **Field Settings with Label**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    |  Headline 1         | Order Approval Request Form
    |  Paragraph          |Please provide the necessary information of your order and submit for approvals.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Form](004.png)

7. Now, add **Input Fields**, enter the labels and select the **Required** checkbox.

    |  **Form Fields**   |  **Field Settings with Label**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Text | Customer Name
    | Text | Order Number
    | Number | Order Amount
    | Date | Order Date
    | Text | Shipping Country
    | Date | Expected Delivery Date

8. The trigger form is ready. Save the form using the **Save** button on the top-right corner of the screen.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Form](005.png)

    Now, you will design the process with more activities related to approval of the sales order.



### Create an approval form


The approval form will be used to get faster and easier approvals from the business users, to take informed decisions, and get rid of sending emails. These approval forms could be about approving or rejecting sales orders, invoices, onboarding, IT requests, etc. The forms are then converted into tasks in an automated workflow which will appear in the **My Inbox** of the user.

You can create these different forms using the **Form Builder** embedded in the process builder using different form field options. You can design and modify them without any coding.   

1. Go to the **Order Processing** process and choose **+** below the Trigger.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](008a.png)

2. Choose **Approval**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](008b.png)

3. Choose **Blank Approval**.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](008c.png)

4. In the **Create Approval** dialog box, do the following:
    - In the Name field enter: **Approval Form**
    - In the Description field enter: **Form to approve or reject the sales order**
    - Choose **Create**

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](009.png)

5. Choose **Open Editor** of the Approval Form.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](010.png)

6. Design the **Approval Form** in the form builder by dragging-and-dropping fields into the form editor and configuring respective field settings.

    |  **Form Fields**    | **Field Settings with Label**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Headline 1 | Approve Sales Order
    | Paragraph  | A new order has been received. Please review and confirm whether the requirements can be met or not.
    | Paragraph  | Sales Order Details:

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](011.png)

7. Add **Input Fields**, enter the labels and select the **Read Only** checkbox.

    |  **Form Fields**   | **Field Settings with Label**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Text | Customer Name
    | Text | Order Number
    | Number | Order Amount
    | Date | Order Delivery Date

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](012.png)

8.  Add **Input Fields** and enter **only** the labels.

    |  **Form Fields** | **Field Settings with Label**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Paragraph | Supplier Acknowledgment
    | Checkbox | I acknowledge that we have received your order and will process it based on the availability
    | Text Area | Message to buyer:
  
9.	**Save** the form.

### Configure an approval form

1. Go back to the process builder to map the process content with the form input fields. 
   
2. Select the **Approval Form** to configure the **General** information section.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](014.png)

3. In the **Subject** field, do the following:
   
    - Enter **Review and approve order**
    - Select **Order Number** from Order Processing Form (Trigger)
    - Enter **from**
    - Select **Customer Name** from Order Processing Form (Trigger)
    - Enter **company**

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](015a.png)

    > The Subject configuration of the form will be shown when this task appears in the `MyInbox`.

4. In the **Recipients** section, under **Users** select **Process Started By** from Process Metadata.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](016.png)

    > This form will appear as the task in the `MyInbox` of the given Recipients to take action.

5. In the **Due Date** section:
    - Select **Static Duration** as **type of due date**
    - Enter **2 Days** as the duration

    > ### What is going on?
    > This means that the due date to approve or reject the form will be set to 2 days.

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](017.png)

    As the task appears in the `MyInbox`, there will be duration information shown to the recipients like Overdue if the task was not completed in 2 days, or within 1 day if the task is supposed to be completed in 1 day etc.


6.	Similarly, go to the **Inputs** section and map the different input fields, which were marked as read-only in the approval form, by selecting the respective **Process Content** entry.

    | **Form Input Fields**| **Process Content Entry**
    |  :------------- | :-------------
    | Customer Name | Customer Name
    | Order Delivery Date |  Expected Delivery Date
    | Order Amount | Order Amount
    | Order Number | Order Number

    > The process content will highlight the entries with the same data type of the input field. For example: if the input field is of Number type then Process Content will show only number-type entries.

7. **Save** the process. 

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](018.png)

    The process should look like the following:

    <!-- border -->
    ![Approval](020.png)


### Create and configure form for notifications


After the user approves or rejects the request, the next step is to create notifications. These notifications will inform the requester whether their sales order is approved or rejected, and will be sent either via an email or through the form. They will appear in the inbox of the requester as a task.

1. To add a confirmation to the process, select **+** below the **Approve** option.

    ![Notifications](027.png)  

    With this you completed designing and configuring the confirmation notification form.

    > You can copy the same form to create another form to send a rejection notification to the requester. If copy is not available then create the form in the same way and modify the texts wherever relevant as shown below.
